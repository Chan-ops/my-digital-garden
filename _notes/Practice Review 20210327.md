I used to Overthink: 

Do a lot of research first to develop and support initial ideas, maybe because of lacking self-confidence. But after trying a lot of "Quick Art" recently, I found that the mode of quick art is more fun: when starting a practice, without any clear purpose, just do it, and analyze them afterwards: **What am I thinking? what do I want to express in my subconscious mind?**

Second, it is also because of the article "Heard Your Voice". Although this article has nothing to do with Art, it clearly allows me to understand the problem of my previous method: constantly researching other people's works or articles is listening to other people's voices, while ignoring my voice to some extent.

So the next steps are very clear, that is to practice continuously, without overthinking, without thinking about: "Eh, is this too simple?" "Will this be not 'deep' enough", because my thoughts do not appear suddenly, it is rooted in my brain, maybe I don't know it, but it will be reflected in the work after all.

PS. I learned about a very simple thing that I have overlooked for a long time:

Practice, whether it's video or photography, is the same as writing. Sometimes I don't know what I want to write. I just write. And it feels weird that I just come up with this, cos I’m not a professional writer, but seems like I’m braver on writing.
