> *“How we approach Women's Experience?”
   “What's being a female mean to us?”
   “How can we ‘Be a Female’?”
   “ Do we need to learn how to be a Female?”*

These questions have always troubled me, including how to define myself as a female artist. **I can't even seriously claim to be a Feminist because I thought that I could not find my place in the spectrum of feminist theory.**

I've been lost for a long time, blaming myself as a feminist and artist couldn't do anything about the current situation. I tried the best to read a lot of feminist theories, but theories don't help. *（Sometimes, I am obsessed with these theories, and sometimes I feel that, especially on the issue of feminism, the theory, in a sense, limits many possibilities and "may" cause theoretical disagreements among women—this further driven divergence in ideas. But we suppose to sit together and fight together.*）**I think I forgot one thing: before I became a Female or Feminist, I'm myself.**

That's what we're doing in the workshop, sitting together, be ourselves, talking about our experiences freely and comfortably, without judgment or reactions. During the session, I felt like I'm an individual and my voices are worthy of being heard and respected.

As long as we are ourselves, be ourselves, and share and write our own narrative, that's "feminism." Our self-identification happened here and formed women's group consciousness.
