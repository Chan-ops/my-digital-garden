I’m confused about my working process, so I try to sort it out though writing.
First question is How to connect my practices, or should I just do as much practices as possible?
I think I should review my writings frequently and step back to think about them,  can be develop more? Any connections between each practice or draft?

Anyway, I jot down some ideas about my practices and research directions👇

### Identity Fragmentation:
Recently, I wanna do something about **Identity fragmentation**, that’s the most resonate topic with me. It’s inspired by a hit topic in china called "小镇做题家", Which originally means that people from small town, so good at exams and study, therefore they went to best universities in China(normally situated in big cities), but the huge gap in the culture and lifestyle between small town and big cities are bothering them.

I feel the same, (Although I'm not good at study and went to best university in china, like them.) sometimes I think I’m a totally different person when I back to my hometown, which is really small, compared with another myself in big cites, Not to mention I’m now in a totally different country.

But I don’t know how to started, although I write a beginning sentence: *Born in a small town, I never… my family…*  I think I should write first, then think about other things.

### Social expectation and pressure
I was thinking about what the most thing I wanna express?
Might be against social expectation? And try to create a feeling of pressure and powerlessness.
I might start with familial relations, that is to say, write from childhood to adulthood, from my family to the family relationship in Chinese society.

Some questions: (leading my research?)

* How does social expectation affect familial relations?
* How does gender perception affect familial relations?
* How does power live in family relationships? That is, the composition and embodiment of power in family relations.

### Non-binary and binary opposition
Questions:

* How do the entire socio-cultural system and gender division framework affect **binary opposition**?
* How does language affect the binary opposition of our thinking?
* How to blend ‘non-binary’ into  writing?
	* Try to start writing from **multi-perspectives**: Father; mother and I as a Daughter. VS. Single perspective, don't have to be objective.
		* May need to get involved in the psychological motivation behind the characters?
		* Start with a series of why: Why do they want to do this? Why do they think so? I still need to write these questions first, and then modify them through psychological motivation analysis, which would be better.
	* However, is it possible to go the other way? The above idea is to describe from multiple perspectives. Is it possible to describe from the opposite perspective, that is, a **single perspective**— my perspective, and I will guess my parents’ thoughts, with prejudice. I think this angle will be easier to write, and more emotional, and can also function as self-reflection.

In addition to external factors when considering Gender politics, I should also consider the contradictions within women:
Could write about mom and I arguing. I remember during quarantine, I’ve sent a clip from a podcast to mom:

“If you are always told: You don’t have to fight like a man, you can marry if you can’t, let a man support the family, a woman should be taken care of, etc. , You do feel that you shouldn’t bear so much, and doing more is redundant anyway. As for what you want, how much you want to endure, and how much you want to achieve, these may not enter your primary consideration. In fact, this is the so-called 'hostile sexism' the greatest harm to women."**²**

At that time I thought she decently will resonate, but She still used Victim blaming to see women who were hurt by domestic violence, and said: *Why can't they just be brave?*

In fact, this is also related to **binary opposition**, I think. Because binary puts men and women on opposite sides and ignores the diversity of gender. Women’s internal conflicts are also a very interesting perspective, and this is reflected in China as the strong indoctrination of upper-level intellectuals, rather than the spontaneous needs of ordinary people**¹**. So I think this can be reflected in the argument between me and my mother, and why there is no ‘spontaneous demand’ is worth studying. That is to say, it is worth studying why women accuse women after something happened.

Also think about: is this the relationship between gender and class as stated in the article *Gender duality, genderless gender, gender-only politics: reflection on the knowledge reproduction of Gender in China?* **³**

And I should google gender politics.
