## Liminality
Currently, some of my practices are dealing with Liminality:

* Every/day*(fig.01,02)*: exploring the Liminality within time;
* fill the space*(fig.03)*: exploring the Liminality between my body and space;
* I'm not sure is 'one day, someday'*(fig.04)* related to Liminality or not, but I think it shows the differences in-between my everyday actions(things I've done). Also time-based.

For the first two practices, I mainly use photography. The last one is represented by text(daily writing).

## Identity and Gender
I still think **’research about identity and gender'** is too broad to discuss, even I write down **"discovering the relationship between identity&gender and social discipline or social expectation"**. (I should start with directly google this). **And I particularly interested in 'Society's Discipline for Women'.**

A current Practice is about identify myself by what I'm not. *(fig.05)*

But some questions popped in:

* Does 'define myself by I'm not' also represent a sense of 'Binary thinking'?

But When I say:"I'm not A." that doesn't mean "I'm -A".

When giving this example, I realize that the "Positive and negative" in this case is quite interesting. Thus, another question came out: Why are numbers positive and negative?

## **the relationship between mother and daughter**

**I’m also discussing the narrative of the relationship between mother and daughter; and how such relations connected with or influenced by patriarchy or misogyny culture in China.** To some extend, I think such an idea also could represent Liminality: the relationship between mother and daughter is private, whereas practices expressing such relation is to place such personal space into the public space. **So, does that means the pieces are the Liminality between private and public space?** Also, (it just suddenly popped into my mind) one of the most significant conflicts in such a relationship is between social expectation and self-expectation/self-identity. (Chizuko Ueno also mentioned misogyny and mother and daughter's relationship in her book: 厌女-上野千鹤子. )

There's another perspective to discuss: Motherhood(母职in Chinese.), but I'm not quite understand this concept, so that I might save it for later.

## My revenge, a fiction story
In the beginning, I want to portray my ex-flatmate like a clown. But during the research, I found that: Many people believe that 'selling public persona' or 'Obsession with material life' are widely happen in females (need to add and translate more evidence). So I started to be wary; I don't want my works to accentuate such prejudice on objectifying women and misogyny. Then I started thinking about why and how this happened? **I believe that such behaviours are structural problems of society, and people like my former flatmate are victims(including myself).** So, if we're the victims, then who should we blame? Despite the psychology of human nature, I could think about: Society's Discipline for Women, Consumerism, and misogyny.

> Consumerism is a tool for realising misogyny.

## Language and Binary Opposition
I'm also interested in the relationship between language and binary opposition: **how language influenced our binary opposition thinking**. I can start with sexism in English (because I saw related papers a few days ago) and look at sexism in Chinese.
