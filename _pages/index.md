# ðŸŒ± Hello! ðŸŒ±

Welcome to my Digital Research Garden, which mapping out all my researches by imitating how brian works. *(This was inspired by [You and your mind garden - Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden), and [Andy Matuschak's Website](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes))*


## Thereâ€™s no index or navigation in here, youâ€™ll need to follow a link to some starting point.

Maybe start with my [[Recent Focus]]?

I publish [[practice and research review]] every few weeks. 

Recently, we started a workshop: East Asian Women Artist Workshop. (ðŸ‘‰   [[Before I became a Female or Feminist, Iâ€™m myself.]])
