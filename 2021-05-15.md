I've been talking to a friend this night, and discussed few interesting things. 

## Why Contemporary Art situation is difficult in China?
生活水平
应试教育的局限性
作品集机构的误导
Z世代被舆论洗脑

## Language
One is about a recent project -- a utopia where human only have the brain. 

I have 3 perspectives towards this project, one is Language. Imaging in a society only communicate using imagination or consciousness, then do they still need language?  

This leads to a long conversation between us. 

However, we've been talking about 3 things: 

1. different languages make the world apart. 
2. A biggest character of language is that it causes lies. 
3. Language causes misunderstandings. 

I highly doubt these 3, but think it's an interesting way to approach language.
